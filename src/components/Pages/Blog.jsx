            1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
            where should we store them on the client-side?
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500">
            As the name may suggest, an ID token is an artifact that client
            applications can use to consume the identity of a user. For example,
            the ID token can contain information about the name, email, and
            profile picture of a user.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500">
            As mentioned, for security purposes, access tokens may be valid for
            a short amount of time. Once they expire, client applications can
            use a refresh token to "refresh" the access token.

            2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500">
            SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are
            horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL
            databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL
            databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is
            better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

            3. What is express js? What is Nest JS?
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500">
            Express is a minimalist and flexible framework that is easy to use
            and has a large community of developers. NestJS, on the other hand,
            is a newer framework that provides additional features such as
            dependency injection, a modular architecture, and an intuitive CLI.

          </h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500">
            Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a
            collection by means of passing them through different stages.
